Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, Max has the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+

| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |

# 解题思路
既需要联合两表，又要找到最高薪水，那么我们首先让两个表内交起来，然后将结果表需要的列都标明，然后就是要找最高的薪水，用Max关键字来实现.
