+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |

# 例子:

```
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
```

# 解题思路
很简单的比较问题，可以生成两个实例对象进行内交通过ManagerId和Id，然后限制条件是一个Salary大于另一个即可.
